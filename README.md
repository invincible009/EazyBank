## Description
When building microservices, the general approach is to take existing monoliths and to decompose their components into microservices.
Instead of migrating all legacy applications at once, we can allow an organic process of decomposition to drive the birth of new cloud-native applications that
strangle data away from shared databases used by legacy applications. The cloud-native strangler pattern focuses on the complete replacement of a monolith's 
database access over a period of time.

In this approach microservices will be transitioned to become the system of record for domain data used by strangled legacy applications.
The process of performing an on-demand migration of data out of a shared database will require that only one system of record exists at any one time.
To solve this, a Legacy Edge application acts as an API gateway to allow legacy applications to talk to new microservices.
